# Module 2: Taught by Dr. Brittany Terese Fasy

The lecture notes and hw for module 2 of CSCI 246 (Spring 2022) are found in
this directory.

## How to ... compile the PDF

These lecture notes and HW are written up in LaTex, the most popular tool used
to write in mathematics and computer science.  Like HTML and Markdown, LaTex
uses markup tagging to format the document.  You write in plain text, then
compile the PDF document using a LaTex compiler.  To compile just one part of
the notes (for example, H-3), use add an % symbol at the start of all lines
that have an \include{} statement, except for the one that names the part you
want to compile.

### If you want to work locally ...

Download LaTex, and your favorite GUI for it, then start working!  The workflow
on your own computer is highly personal, so I won't tell you how to do that.
But, I will link to a couple helpful websites:

* [The Latex Project](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/tex/latex-start.html)
* [Getting Started with LaTex](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~hildebr/tex/latex-start.html)

### If you want to work on a web-based copiler

1. Zip up this directory (be sure to zip everything!).
2. Go to overleaf.com and sign in.
3. On the LHS, select "New Project". From the dropdown, select "Upload project" and you can upload the zip file.
