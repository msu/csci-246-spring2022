        \paragraph{Answer}
        \todo{}

    \item What is the ``muddiest point'' in this class so far?  (That is, what
        concept / proof / definition have you seen that you are the least
        comfortable with?)  If there are multiple ``muddy points,'' list them.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is the following statement true: If $p$ is a prime number, then $p$ is an odd
        integer. Justify.\label{part:thestmt}
        \paragraph{Answer}
        \todo{}

    \item Negate the statement in Part \ref{part:thestmt}. above.
        \paragraph{Answer}
        \todo{}

    \item Is the negation in the previous part true or false? Justify.
        \paragraph{Answer}
        \todo{}

    \item Give the contrapositive of the statement in Part \ref{part:thestmt}. above.
        \paragraph{Answer}
        \todo{}

    \item Is the contrapositive that you gave in the previous part true or
        false? Justify.
        \paragraph{Answer}
        \todo{}

    \item Your friend gave you the following proof that multiples of $4$ are
        even: \emph{Let $n=100$.  Since $n=4\cdot 25$, we have that $n$ is a multiple
        of $4$.  Also, $n=2\cdot 50$; therefore, by definition of even, $n$ is
        even.}  Does this proof work?  Why or why not?

Suppose $n$ is an integer whose decimal representation ends in $5$.  Prove that
$5$ divides $n$. (Hint: recall that the decimal number $532$ can be written as
the sum $5\cdot 100 + 3 \cdot 10 + 2 \cdot 1$).

\nextprob{Quotient-Remainder Theorem (1 point)}

Let $n$ be an integer.  Then, $n$ can be written in one of the three forms:
$$
    n=3q
    \text{ or }
    n=3q+1
    \text{ or }
    n=3q+2
$$
for some integer $q$. (Hint: Use the QRT).
